                <h1 id="contribution-guidelines">Contribution Guidelines</h1>
<p>Thanks for your willingness to contribute to ZubHub!</p>
<p>The following are a set of guidelines to follow when contributing to this project.</p>
<h2 id="have-a-question-idea-or-suggestion">Have A Question, Idea or Suggestion?</h2>
<p>Start by reviewing current and past issues to see if your question/idea/suggestion has already been reported or discussed before. If what you are proposing is completely new, start by formalizing the idea and create an issue in the repository. In the text, make sure you have the following sections at the very least. 1) Motivation 2) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story">User Story</a> The existing committers on this project work to reach consensus around project direction and issue solutions within issue threads (when appropriate). If it is a security issue, please do not file an issue on Github and read <a href="#security-issues">this</a></p>
<h2 id="code-reviews">Code Reviews</h2>
<p>All submissions should come in the form of pull requests and need to be reviewed by project committers. Read <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/">GitHub's pull request documentation</a> for more information on sending pull requests.</p>
<h2 id="from-contributor-to-committer">From Contributor To Committer</h2>
<p>We love contributions from our community! If you'd like to go a step beyond contributor and become a committer with full write access and a say in the project, you must be invited to the project. The existing committers employ an internal nomination process that must reach lazy consensus (silence is approval) before invitations are issued. If you feel you are qualified and want to get more deeply involved, feel free to reach out to existing committers to have a conversation about that.</p>
<h2 id="security-issues">Security Issues</h2>
<p>Security issues shouldn't be reported on the repository issue tracker. Instead, mail us at admin@unstructured.studio with details about the issue including any screenshots, PoC or any other relevant detail.</p>
<h2 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h2>
<p>All contributors, commiters and users should conform and agree to the Unstructured Studio Code of Conduct when engaging with ZubHub community. The Code of Conduct is a set of guidelines that explains how our community behaves and what we value to members and outsiders. The Code of Conduct is a living document and will be updated when and if it is deemed necessary.</p>
<p>The Code of Conduct is not "code" in the sense of being an algorithm or a computer program. The Code of Conduct is not "blindly and algorithmically" executed but is instead enforced by humans making real decisions based on all of the available information and using all available context.</p>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

<p>Technical, organization and any other discussions on our channels, repositories, issue-tracker, ZubHub platform, and posts should focus on education, creativity and open source tools/techology related to it. Our aim is to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone. Therefore, avoid personal attacks on others, and  avoid inflammatory language and speech that perpetuates discrimination. Furthermore we request you not to use ZubHub, Unstructured Studio this platform as a basis to engage in personal campaigns against other organizations or individuals.</p>
<h3 id="engagement-standards">Engagement Standards</h3>
