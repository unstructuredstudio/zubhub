## Media Container

On Zubhub, there are two ways to handle media storage. We can use online services to host our media files (We currently only support digital ocean spaces for images and Cloudinary for videos files), or we can opt to host it locally on the media container. This container runs a custom Django code used to handle the upload and serving of images and video.

You can play with the Interactive documentation of the media server API endpoints by setting up zubhub on your local machine and visiting **http://localhost:8000**.
