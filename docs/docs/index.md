### **Prerequisties**

> * [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) OR [Linux - VM / Dual boot]()
> * [Github](https://github.com/)
> * [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)  
> * [Docker Compose ](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
> * [Make](https://linuxhint.com/install-make-ubuntu/)

### **Cloning Repo**: 
Clone the Zubhub Repo using the following commands

```git
git clone https://github.com/unstructuredstudio/zubhub.git
```


Alternatively on Linux machine you can install docker by running a command given below:
```bash
bash onetime-setup.sh
```

Make sure you are into the zubhub directory!




**Change** the **Directory** to the zubhub folder using:

```bash
cd zubhub
```

### **Backend:**

- Change directory to `./zubhub_backend`

- Run `make init` to do all the initial setups required and start the server. `make init` generates the minimal .env file required to run the backend, 
  spins-up all containers defined in the backend docker-compose file,
  applies all necessary migrations to the database,
  and creates a default admin user with 
  username and password of dummy and dummy_password respectively.
  
  Subsequently to start and stop the docker containers, use `make start`, `make stop`, or `make down`. (run `make help` to see all the available make commands).

- Visit [`localhost:8000`](localhost:8000)on your browser to access the API documentation.

### **Frontend:**

Go inside the Frontend directory by running commands

```bash
cd ..  
```

```bash
cd zubhub_frontend/zubhub
```

- Create a file named .env in the frontend  folder (same directory with package.json)
- Copy the content of .env.example and paste into the new .env file.
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
- Run `make start` to spin up the frontend container.
- Visit [`localhost:3000`](localhost:3000) on your browser to access the frontend.
